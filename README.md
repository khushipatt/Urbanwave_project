# UrbanWave - MongoDB Social Media Analytics

Built a mini social media platform in MongoDB for my college analytics assignment in semester 5.

# Project Overview
- Database: MongoDB (NoSQL)
- Collections: `users`, `posts`, `followers`
- Features: CRUD operations, aggregation queries, 2dsphere geospatial indexing
- Location Data: Gujarat cities with geo-coordinates (Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, etc.)

# Key Skills Demonstrated
- Schema design with JSON validation
- Geospatial queries (users within 100km radius, distance calculations)
- Aggregation pipelines for analytics (screen time, popular reels, sorting)
- Data filtering, sorting, and CRUD operations

# Business Insights Generated
- Top content creators by engagement (likes, views, shares)
- Location-based user analysis (nearby users, city-wise distribution)
- User behavior patterns (screen time >150min, active users)

# What I Learned
- GeoJSON vs regular JSON for location data
- MongoDB indexing for performance
- Complex aggregation for business analytics
